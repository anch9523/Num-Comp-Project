# Num-Comp-Project

This project explores the word2vec algorithm, a machine learning algorithm created by Google to create vector representations of words in order to produce similarity scores. We performed an experiment to test the model's performance on solving different types of analogies and across different dimensions of vectors. 

The code for the experiment can be found in experiment.ipynb, along with preliminary findings. The full results along with graphs can be found in experiment_results_with_graphs.xlsx.
